# SketchCord
Sketchcord is used to send messages to Discord using Discord Webhooks by sending http requests. It is an unofficial (REST)API. Works great with Sketchware/Sketchware Pro/ Sketchware Revolution or Sketchware Gold.

#Hosting
To use it, you can use the default API, https://sketchcord.heroku.app/api/send or https://sketchcord-production.up.railway.app/api/send. But If your app is too popular, you can deploy the API yourself. Just click the below button to deploy on Heroku.
